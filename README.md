"A chrome extension that shows a bunch of shortcuts that are relevant/useful to me. Hopefully I have them memorized shortly. Then onto new and better shortcuts!" 
Things to do -- plenty.
  -> compile a list of shortcuts I want
  -> Probably add some tabs for what the shortcuts are relevant to e.g. a Chrome tab, Sublime, Windows...
  ----That will probably be easiest with a little javascript. Or maybe I can do that with pure css? hmmm
  -> Speaking of css, style that popup. Currently looks terrible.
